# A simple program that allows users to define a square or rectangle based on length and width dimensions. The user can then get the area, perimeter or diagonal of the defined shape. The program can also return a picture of the shape in the form of a string that draws the shape in asterisks. This program was produced as part of the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp.org. Created by Jacob Hexamer.
